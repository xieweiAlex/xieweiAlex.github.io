        "body": "How it started I got an Internet call(anonymous call) at 11 am, I hesitated a few seconds because most of those calls are scam, but I took it. It was a female police officer saying my motorcycle has been found and it\u0026rsquo;s in Fremont, she wanted me to come around ASAP. I was like, What!? üòÆüòÆ I was over the moon immediately, it has been 2 weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve already crossed off my shopping list for my bike, I said I will be there very soon. I grabbed my helmet and gloves and was thinking I might be better riding in local instead of freeway in case it isn\u0026rsquo;t in a good shape, as always, I\u0026rsquo;m too optimistic.üôÇ\nRight on spot After I arrived the industrial area in Fremont, I got a feeling of gang fight scene in the movie, deserted factories, ragged road, tons of heavy duty truck buzzing around. I approached the police car, officer Santana asked me to sign some paper work, I asked \u0026ldquo;Where is my bike?\u0026quot;, \u0026ldquo;there it is\u0026rdquo;, she pointed me to an RV. The bike was bonded with an RV with lots bruises on the body. Then I saw the engine lock with ignition has been cut off, windshield and left mirror are gone. I definitely CAN NOT ride it home.\nhttps://xieweialex.github.io/static/img/motorcycle-found/ignition-off.jpg\nI started contacting my insurance agent for help, to my surprise, she was cranky, even cruel in my opinion. She responded \u0026ldquo;What do you want me to do for you? You\u0026rsquo;re not my customer anymore, I\u0026rsquo;m crossing off your name in my customer list\u0026rdquo;, I was like, ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì üòÆ\nI am very inexperienced and helpless, being stranded on the road, I know my insurance has been expired (my insurance expired two weeks ago right before the bike got stolen which is another bummer), she has all the rights not to help me, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand why she choice to burn the bridge, she can just say anything top of her mind could guide me even a little bit, it won\u0026rsquo;t cost her anything but few seconds, she even didn\u0026rsquo;t give an excuse like I\u0026rsquo;m busy or in the middle of a meeting something like that, and just hung up, twice!!! I was shocked. That\u0026rsquo;s very unprofessional and unacceptable! I will try to use my influence (if I have or will have) to talk people away from her service from now on. üò° she sucks!\nThen I moved on trying to contact my friend looking for help, Officer Santana cruised back and told me that she wants get the bike out of the scene as soon as possible, she can\u0026rsquo;t leave without knowing my bike is still there. Because the person being arrested will be released today and he might come back anytime, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me getting into conflict on spot. I was like WTH üòÆ! I also feel warm she came back and inform me, she cared about me even though she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know me at all, comparing with Joana, she is so nice. I decided to manual roll the bike to a safer place, few blocks away behind a building.\nTowing options The next thing is towing it back, I realized I should not tow it back to my home since it requires immediate repair. I contacted a motorcycle transport service from RMC moto, he replied that he just had a motorcycle accident which needs to stay in bed for 1-2 weeks. I suddenly feel so grateful that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any motorcycle accident, bike being stolen away isn\u0026rsquo;t the worse situation. Then I contacted another motorbike mover, he asked for $125, I said fine, let\u0026rsquo;s do it. If my insurance is still valid, I could\u0026rsquo;ve saved the money and hassles.\nLate lunch around 3 pm on the bike My phone somehow being an asshole for me the whole day, threw a lots of unexpected behaviors, after hours of frustration I realized that I upgraded another Beta iOS version last night, it was a mistake. I was so helpless while my phone stopped working, it was the only way to contact outside people and asking help from the internet.\nRepair options I pulled my bike to RMC moto, the mechanic gave me the estimate around $1400, my heart sunk. I was hoping it could below $1000, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid to spend too much on the bike but I still want to ride, I guess I will go with that.\nConclusion Today is Thanksgiving, one of the most important holiday in America, I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful that I got my bike back. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a sloppy person, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost many goods in the past. Every time bad luck happens, I whisper to myself \u0026ldquo;Come on, give me a second chance, I will be more careful\u0026rdquo;. This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;m given the second chance, Even though I might need to spend thousands of bucks to repair it.\nThe stocks I own soared yesterday and today, I made $4400 (on paper) just today which is the best day since I started investing in stock market, specially the S\u0026amp;P 500 dropped around 0.5%, I feel cool and grateful. I got some money for my harmed bike. And I went out almost a whole day (11 am to 5 pm) I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t do any work today, but nobody complaints about my absence, I even didn\u0026rsquo;t need to ask permission to leave, I don\u0026rsquo;t take the permissiveness for granted, I thank my teammates/manager and my company. üòá üòò\n"
