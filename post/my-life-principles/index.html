    <p>As as a lifetime learner turned 30, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during the self-exploratory journey. I&rsquo;ve found some principles work for me very well, I&rsquo;d like to write them down publicly, let the sunlight be the disinfectant.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-english">Embrace English</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasis more about the importance of English since I live in the country which English is the official language, I work in the industry English is in dominate position. General English ability (read, speak, write) would be one of my bottleneck for the foreseeable years to come. It takes time, I know that, I hope I can shorten the path.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost doing everything while learn English, I&rsquo;ve always have a E-note with me which highest precedence for my E-notes. I notes English quotes, words, phrase, slangs everyday I encountered, from a casual conversation, official/random email, news media, watch movie / TV show, or just purposefully recite English words in this <a href="https://github.com/xieweiAlex/English_Learning">repo</a>, and 2020 is the 4th year since I started doing it, I&rsquo;m proud of myself.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitalization">Embrace digitalization</h3>
<p>I strongly believe everything could be digitalized will be digitalized, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time and we&rsquo;re just getting started, I&rsquo;m so excited standing on the edge of the curve, there are so much potential and opportunities ahead. And I&rsquo;m also very grateful I stumbled into this field accidentally, and I&rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more and give back more if I can. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant">Sunlight is the best disinfectant</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe transparency is the solution for lots of things I don&rsquo;t understand, as long as they&rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I&rsquo;m more open to it.</p>
<p>Open source is taking over the software development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hope you can make it someday and astonish the world, that&rsquo;s not my style. Just like agile philosophy in software programming, I&rsquo;d like to just crank it out prototype and try fast iteration, as long as it&rsquo;s in the right direction, we can keep progressing.</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-to-make-our-life-better">Use tools to make our life better</h3>
<p>Of course thinking and theory and more comprehensive and they have bigger impact, tools just like materialized object. I know that, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to frequently learn new ideas, but I still want to make my life easier in a easily way. At end of the day, using tool is biggest fact we differentiated with animals. I hope it would one of the way leverage my learning ability and changing velocity.</p>
<p>One of my favoriate tool is Vim, I&rsquo;ve used it for years, I&rsquo;m still learning it on daily basis, I&rsquo;m using it on minute basis once I&rsquo;m on my laptop. I almost only editing/writing everything in Vim environment. This kind of tool has implemented many philosophies and values, learning from a practical tangible tool about those idea is just more fun. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="scaling-scaling-scaling">Scaling, Scaling, Scaling</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become old enough to don&rsquo;t care much about many frivolous things including some nonsense traditions. I&rsquo;d like to do things they can be scaled up, they can be beneficial in a long run.</p>
<h3 id="be-happy-and-be-nice">Be happy and Be nice</h3>
<p>Having a happy balanced life style is very crucial in a long run, most of our time is in the journey, I&rsquo;d like to enjoy the journey, not only the destination.</p>
