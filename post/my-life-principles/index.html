    <p>As I&rsquo;m a lifetime learner turned 30 years old, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot during the journey. I&rsquo;ve found some life principles work for me very well and I&rsquo;d like to write them down to inspect and review them regularly.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-english">Embrace English</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t emphasis more about the importance of English since I live in a country English is the official language, I work in an industry English is in dominate position. General English ability would be one of my bottleneck for the few years I can foresee. It takes time, I have the patient and expectation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinate by the information abundance in English, besides that, almost all the tools and programming ecosystem are in English, most of all, since I write everything in Vim and English in Vim is the best I can get for now. As I&rsquo;m looking to fit in or understand more about the Western culture, language plays a big part in culture (so does food, but I don&rsquo;t see myself would into it that much, I&rsquo;m so proud the tasty, delicacy and abundance of Asian food ðŸ™‚)</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitalization">Embrace digitalization</h3>
<p>Everything could be digitalized will be digitalized, and we&rsquo;re just getting started, I&rsquo;m so excited I&rsquo;m fighting on the edge of revolution every time it comes to my mind. And I&rsquo;m very grateful I was just accidentally get into the battlefield, and I&rsquo;ve been benefiting a lot, and I will try to get more. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant">sunlight is the best disinfectant</h3>
<p>I heavily believe transparency is the solution for lots of things I don&rsquo;t understand, as long as they&rsquo;re transparent, we can hold them accountable, I&rsquo;m more open to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a believer in Open source and Free software, tho I haven&rsquo;t contributed anything, I&rsquo;m ashamed of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything worth doing worthy doing publicly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into bombshells. Burying yourself into a big, grandiose goal and hope you can make it someday and amaze the world, that&rsquo;s just not my style. Just like agile philosophy in software programming, I&rsquo;d like to just crank it out and gather feedback as soon as possible, do retrospective regularly, do fast iteration and make the loop.</p>
<h3 id="use-tools-to-make-our-life-better">Use tools to make our life better</h3>
<p>Of course ideas and thoughts and more comprehensive and bigger impact, tools just like implementation of lots of ideas. I know that, but I still very excited about those small, nice tools.</p>
<p>One of my favoriate tool is Vim, I&rsquo;ve used it for years, I&rsquo;m still learning it on daily basis. I almost put anything editing/writing on Vim. This kind of tool has implemented so many philosophy and ideas, learning from a practical tangible tool about the idea is more fun. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<h3 id="future-oriented">future oriented</h3>
<p>I think in the bottom of my heart, I&rsquo;m still a timid guy who lacks of sense of security. I got so much comfortness and encouragement if I know it gonna work in a foreseeable long time.</p>
<p>delay gratification</p>
<p>sustainable for a long term</p>
<h3 id="be-happy-and-be-nice">Be happy and be nice</h3>
<p>One of big part in western culture I like is it emphasis personal happiness and achievement, I&rsquo;d like to always care for myself, ask myself what do I really want, what makes me happy and do things I think it&rsquo;s right, then I will be happy if I know I&rsquo;m living my own way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy person I think most people around me can feel, I can be happy easily for little small things in life, that&rsquo;s just my nature. But as big things, in a big picture, how do I make myself happy is question for myself all the time in my early 30s.</p>
<p>Well, there are few things make me happy in general, do things political correct(I&rsquo;m a typical leftish libertarian), I feel cool about what I do, I feel myself strong both in mentally and physically, I earn more than I expend, I know what I&rsquo;m doing and it&rsquo;s sustainable or scalable, etc.</p>
<p>Life is imperfect, deal with it and make it better. Some regret make your life more memorable(regardless the result might change if you did it in another way, most probably it is not true).</p>
