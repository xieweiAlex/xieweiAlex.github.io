<h3 id="personal-traits">Personal traits</h3>
<h3 id="animal-lover">Animal lover</h3>
<p>I love animals without a doubt, I always following a handful of cute animal public accounts in any media whatever I use, like Instagram, Twitter, FB or Wechat. I feel genuinely happier when I see cute animals, &ldquo;Thedodo&rdquo; is one of my favorite public account. I like both cats üê± and dogs üê∂. Though I feel cat is more cute in general(I spent more time on cat photos and videos), but I like dog the most, I genuinely admire those natural traits in dogs, like loyal, brave and optimistic. One of my ideal house would be having a small farm in backyard, I can grow some vegetables and live with some small animals.</p>
<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>
<p>Looking back my grow up history, I liked all kinds of sports. Doing exercise makes me healthy and happy in general, and I always get friends while doing sport. I spent a big amount of teenage time playing basketball, I loved it. I played roller skating for years, then years of roller blading in college. I met my first girlfriend while playing roller skate in college. After college, I started like jogging regularly, most of time after at sunset while listening podcast. Recently started in 2019, I started doing weight lifting(or muscle building), skateboarding and riding motorcycle (I consider riding motorcycle is a sport üò∫)</p>
<h3 id="ambivert">Ambivert</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an introvert person for sure, I can and willing to express my feeling and affection relative easily. I talk a lot when with people or topic I&rsquo;m interested in, I believe communication is the key üîë for lots of problems. I enjoy exerting my personal influence to make things be good as well. But I don&rsquo;t have many friends, I&rsquo;m not a fan of gathering or party, social events drain my energy significantly. I rarely contact any of my friends which I know I should do.</p>
<h3 id="open-minded">Open-minded</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m very open-minded and adaptive, I&rsquo;m a typical liberal in America&rsquo;s political spectrum, I&rsquo;m open to a lots of novel ideas, I often got mind blown by those different ideas, and I enjoy exploring them. I despise any nonsense traditions no matter what culture it belongs or how long it has been inherited.</p>
<h3 id="optimist">Optimist</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural optimist, I do feel happy when things are promising, I tend to believe things are going to be good easily. When things are not promising, I tend to make some changes, I always looking for changes, either physically or mentally, consciously or unconsciously, I believe changes bring to good, mistakes better than regrets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="rationalism">Rationalism</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very rational person. I like doing analysis and make good decisions. I believe our life progress bases on the decisions we make every day, whether it&rsquo;s big or small. I tend to analysis the world/society around me, I believe things can be scientific tested.</p>
<h3 id="adventurist">Adventurist</h3>
<p>I enjoy the feeling of risk-taking, it makes me feel cool and alive. I&rsquo;m not a fan of safe bet, that&rsquo;s just too boring. I enjoy the adrenalin spike while riding motorcycle in open freeway(of course I wear protective gear all the time). I enjoy any of those extreme sports, specially those sports require split-second decision making which spikes the adrenalin release. I do those sports to make myself both mentally and physically being strong, and I feel happy when I&rsquo;m feeling strong ‚úä.</p>
